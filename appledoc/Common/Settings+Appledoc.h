/** All appledoc settings as simple properties.
 
 This category extends Settings class by providing simple interface so we don't have to deal with keys. To use it, simply import the header and use the properties. If the instance represents factory defaults, send it applyFactoryDefaults message - it nicely embeds default settings within the category implementation.
 
 @warning **Implementation detail:** Note that we could easily add all properties directly to Settings, but as the class is designed to be as reusable as possible, that would break reusability. All in all, Objective C offers powerful extending mechanism in the form of categories, and this seems like a perfect fit.
