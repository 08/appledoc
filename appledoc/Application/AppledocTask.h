/** Helper base class for all main appledoc tasks.
 
 This class simplifies and unifies common behavior for all different tasks. To use it, create concrete subclass(es), then send `runWithSettings:store:` to instantiated objects to have them do their work. Subclass will return exit code - `0` if everything was succesful, or error code otherwise. You can optionally push your custom helper objects prior to running the task - this gives you ways to customize subclass behavior, although it should not be needed under normal circumstances (the hooks are there primarily for unit testing purposes).
