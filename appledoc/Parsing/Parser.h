/** Source code parsing entry point.
 
 This is the part of the application that parses known objects from input paths and registers them to Store for further processing.
 
 To use, instantiate and send `runWithSettings:store:` message to instantiated object. You can optionally setup desired parsers through properties beforehand, although that's normally not needed - it's primarily meant for unit testing hooks.
